### Short Reflection

Through these tasks, I learned how to integrate AWS services such as S3 and Lambda with Python applications.
The tricky part was managing dependencies and Hugging Face’s API updates, especially the new inference endpoint.
I also gained confidence using environment variables for secure token handling and deploying serverless functions.


### AI Tool Usage Explanation

I used an AI assistant (ChatGPT) to help generate the base Flask and Lambda code structure, fix import errors, and simplify AWS configuration steps.
I then customized, debugged, and deployed each component myself, verifying outputs on both local and cloud environments.
